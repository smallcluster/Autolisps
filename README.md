# Autolisps

A collection of my own autolisp programs for Autocad.


## Programs

### [CIRCLE_BAR_ARCS](/CIRCLE_BAR_ARCS.LSP)
Draws circular rebars (counter-clockwise) in AutoCAD considering the length of the bar, the center of the circle, and the overlap length. Last bar length is trimmed if necessary or an overlap splice is added if the overlap on the first bar is insufficient (a warning is issued in this case).
